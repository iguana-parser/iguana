Iguana
======

Iguana is a Java implemenation of the GLL parsing algorithm. Iguana has the following features:

- Binarized SPPF construction in cubic time and space
- Scannerless parsing
- Supporting common lexical disambiguation mechanism such as follow restrictions, precede restrictions, and keyword reservation
- Support unicode (under development)

Iguana is currently a prototype and is set to replace the parser in [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org).
